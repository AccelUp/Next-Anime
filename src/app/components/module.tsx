To hide an element on small screens and show it on larger screens in a Next.js application, you can utilize Next.js's built-in support for responsive design by using CSS media queries. You can create a CSS module or style directly in your component to apply responsive styling.

Here's how you can achieve this using a CSS module in a Next.js component:

Create a CSS module file (e.g., styles.module.css) if you haven't already.

In your component file, import the CSS module and use it to define the styles for hiding and showing the element based on screen size.

Use CSS media queries to control the visibility of the element. For your specific requirement, you want to hide it on small screens (e.g., screens with a maximum width of 768px) and show it on larger screens.

Here's an example of how your code might look:

jsx
Copy code
// styles.module.css
.hideOnSmall {
  display: none;
}

.showOnLarge {
  display: block;
}

/* Define a media query for small screens (up to 768px) */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hideOnSmall {
    display: block;
  }
  .showOnLarge {
    display: none;
  }
